## Overview

Each six-week session, all students in modules 2, 3, and 4 will give one five-minute lightning talk to their peers. Lightning talk preparation will take approximately 2-4 hours. **In place of a lightning talk, a student may elect to prepare and lead a 1-hour student-led session for Friday's elective block.**

## Schedule

During intermission week, submit a pull request for that module's markdown file and add your topic. Topic choices will be first-come, first-served. 

During the week of your lighting talk or student-led session, the schedule will be as follows:

* **Monday**: Submit your topic to the markdown file  **before 4pm**. 
* **Tuesday**: Add your outline as a gist **before 4pm**. Please don't make us hunt you down!
* **Wednesday**: Draft slides and/or content for presentation. You do not need to submit anything.
* **Thursday**: Rehearsal in Classroom C after wrap up. Your slides and content should be prepared in advance as laptops will be closed during rehearsal. Attendance is mandatory for both lightning talkers and students who are leading sessions. 
* **Friday**: Present your 5-minute talk or student-led session for your Turing peers.  

## Topics & Themes

All topics must be approved 

**Module 2 students**: It is preferred that your topic fit into one of the themes below. That said, feel free to pitch a topic related to your experience prior to Turing. Keep in mind that the topic should be of interest to a school of software developers and that the topic must be approved before moving forward. 

**Module 3 and 4 students**: Your topic should fit into one of the themes below:

* Computer Hardware
* Computer Science
* Design / User Experience
* DevOps
* Front End Development
* General Software Methodologies / Techniques
* Historical or Present-day People in Computer Science
* JavaScript Architecture / Libraries
* Programming & Science
* Programming & the Arts
* Programming Languages
* Ruby Architecture / Libraries
* Software Libraries
* Software Testing
* Technology & Law
* Technology & Society
* Technology & Ethics
* Web Technologies

When considering the content of your presentation, take care to promote a welcoming environment for all students regardless of their age, gender, socio-economic background, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation. 

## Picking a Topic

* You don't need to be an expert on a topic. You can do the research and become expert enough to deliver a valuable talk.
* A talk needs to teach something of value to the audience.
* A talk needs to be at an appropriate level for the audience, not too basic and not too advanced.
* A talk needs to have a *message*, not just a subject. "Introduction to RSpec" is boring, "Why You Should Use RSpec" has a message.
